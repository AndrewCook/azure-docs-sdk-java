# Get started with the Azure SDK for Java

## Prerequisites

- Maven
- Java 8

This get started guide uses the Maven build tool to build and run Java source code, but other build tools such as Gradle or SBT work fine with the Java SDK for Azure.

## Install the Azure SDK for Java

Follow [the install instructions](java-install-azure-sdk.md) to get the SDK on your development system and verify the installation.

## Set up authentication

Your Java application will need access to information and objects in your Azure subscription, but you don't want to use your personal account information directly in your programs. Create a service principal in Azure to run your code under, which will have its own set of credentials 

## Create a Linux virtual machine

## Deploy a simple webapp from GitHub

## List virtual machines in a subscription

## Get sample code

## Review the reference and release notes

## Get help from the community
